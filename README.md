Overview
---
This project shows how to find lane lines in a pictur/video of the road using Python and OpenCV.

Project files description
---
1. **'P1.ipynb'** is a file in Jupyter notebook format. Contain all code to finding lane lines in images and videos. You can open it by GitHub page in your browser or download and open/run by [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook editor. More information how to use  Jupyer at [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111). 
2. **P1.html** is a html version of the 'P1.ipynb' file. You can download it and open in your browser. (It is to big to open it directly by GitHub).
3. **'\examples'** directory contains images and videos to show how detected lane lines should look like.
4. **'\test_images'** and **'/test_videos'** directories contain images and videos to play with the code from the 'P1.ipynb'. 
5.  **'\test_images_output'** and **'\test_videos_output'** contain images and videos after use the code from the 'P1.ipynb' on files from '/test_images' and '/test_videos'.
6. **'environment.yml'** is a file to build python environmet with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to run the code form the 'P1.ipynb'. More information about Conda and python environmets at [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1111).
7. **'writeup.md'** contains written report about this Project.

Software Requirement
---
Software was written in Python language. All necessery python and packages dependencies are in the file _environment.yml_. To build enviroment you need _Conda_ (dependency and package managment system).
